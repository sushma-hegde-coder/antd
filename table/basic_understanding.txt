Table column
Table data

each row (rendered) executed from left to right

render-takes each row
{
  title: "Name",
  dataIndex: "name", ----name should be in data of table
  key: "1",
  render: (tableRow: any) => <>{console.log("tableRow", tableRow)}</>,
},

if dataIndex is not given then row data is not displayed

assume there are 3 col
name          age           gender     tags
sushma        24           female      created

starts rendering from const columns
comes to first row,sees title displays title, sees dataIndex, sees whether it is in const data, if it is there then displays
"render:" is needed in that col-row where there is no data from user, if you want to display some icons or some tags, you can give any conditions and can display what you want to display accordingly
